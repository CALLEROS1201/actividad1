## About This Repository

This repository was created as part of Activity 1.  
Its purpose is to serve as a personal reference for Git commands and Markdown syntax, which are essential tools for version control and software development.

## What is Markdown?

Markdown is a lightweight markup language used to format plain text in a simple and readable way.  
It allows developers to create structured documents without complex syntax.

Markdown is commonly used for:
- README files
- Software documentation
- GitHub repositories
- Technical notes
- Blogs

Markdown is popular because it is easy to learn and converts cleanly into HTML.

## Markdown Tagging Options

### Headings
Markdown allows different heading levels to organize content clearly.

### Text Formatting
You can apply **bold**, *italic*, and ~~strikethrough~~ formatting to text to emphasize important information.

### Lists
Markdown supports both unordered and ordered lists:
- Unordered lists use bullet points
- Ordered lists use numbers

### Links
You can create links such as:  
[GitHub](https://github.com)

### Images
Images can be added to documentation to provide visual support.

### Code
Markdown supports inline code formatting like `git status` and code blocks for commands and examples.

### Tables
Tables are useful for organizing information clearly.

| Command | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| git status | Shows repository status |
| git add | Adds files to staging |
| git commit | Saves changes |
